    "title": "challenged by a lack of versatile preclinical models. Recently, the advancements in the organoid industry have provided novel strategies to break through this dilemma. Here, we summarize the existing biological and engineering approaches that were employed to generate oral and maxillofacial organoids. Then, we detail the use of modiﬁed co-culture methods, such as cell cluster co-inoculation and air-liquid interface culture technology to reconstitute the vascular network and immune microenvironment in",
