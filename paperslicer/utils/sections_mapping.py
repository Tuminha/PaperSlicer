Canonical section mapping utilities.

This module centralizes the normalization of section headings to a
restricted set of canonical keys used by PaperSlicer.

Canonical keys (current):
 - abstract
 - introduction
 - materials_and_methods
 - results
 - discussion
 - conclusions
 - results_and_discussion

We intentionally skip non-content boilerplate (acknowledgements, funding, etc.).
